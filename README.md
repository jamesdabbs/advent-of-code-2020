Contains my solution to [2020 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) problems, in several languages.

* [Haskell](https://github.com/jamesdabbs/advent-of-code-2020/tree/main/hs)
* [TypeScript](https://github.com/jamesdabbs/advent-of-code-2020/tree/main/ts)

My main goal in working through these is to practice writing [boring](https://dev.to/mjuraj/you-should-write-boring-code-12fd) code in languages I might not otherwise get to practice. These solutions aren't the leanest or most highly optimized, but they strive to be clear and easy to grok and maintain. Where possible, I aim to make similar decisions as I would at work: picking well-supported libraries where it makes sense, and ensuring that interfaces are clear, reasonable, and well-tested.
